## What is D3js ##
D3.js (Data Driven Documents) is not a programming language. It is a JavaScript based library used for creating dynamic data displays.
D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation.
